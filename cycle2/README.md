# Necat Toolâ€“ Replacing Netcat - the Networking Utility Knife
# The Why I am interested in building this tool
   During the previous classes we built C2 client and servers, so, I wanted to continue increasing my knowledge in python networking and build a tool for my toolkit that replaces Netcat in 
   case it is not installed or available in the system.
#Background:
Netcat is the utility knife of networking, so most system administrators remove it from their systems. Such a useful tool would be awesome asset if an attacker managed to find a way in. With it, you can execute remote commands, open remote shells, pass files back and forth, set up a listener that gives you command line access, among others. This is a great tool to have without having to first burn one of your trojans or backdoors. 
# Three main Tool Points
   1.	Usefulness: This tool can handle multiple tasks such as port scanning, OS fingerprinting, executing remote commands, and setting up remote shell. Due to the lack of time, I only          implemented some of the features.
   2.	Customizability: Unlike standard Netcat, this Python implementation can be easily modified and extended to suit specific needs and requirements. Users can add new features or adjust      existing ones to better fit their use cases.
   3.	Secondary Access: The tool is invaluable for creating a secondary access point in case of a compromised system, without needing to deploy more intrusive backdoors or trojans. This         feature is particularly useful for maintaining persistent access during penetration testing or after exploiting a vulnerability.
# Requirements
   1.	Python 3.x: The script is written in Python and requires Python 3.x to run. Install Python from the official Python website if not already available on your system.
   2.	Kali Linux or Compatible Linux Distribution: This tool is designed and tested on Kali Linux. While the tool should work on other Linux distributions, using Kali ensures compatibility    and access to additional security tools.
   3.	Network Access: Both the target and user machines must have network connectivity to communicate with each other. Ensure that firewalls or security groups allow the required ports for    communication.
   4.	Permissions: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to bind to the specified ports and execute commands on both machines.
   Note: Using Kali Linux 2024.1 already has all the requirements to run this tool.
# Future Direction / Areas of Improvement
   1.	Enhanced Security: Adding encryption to the data transmission to prevent interception and misuse.
   2.	File Transfer Capability: Reintegrating and improving the file transfer functionality to be more robust and secure.
   3.	Error Handling: Improved error handling and logging for better debugging and reliability.
   4.	User Authentication: Adding authentication mechanisms to restrict access and ensure that only authorized users can connect and execute commands.
   5.	Cross-Platform Compatibility: Testing and ensuring compatibility across various operating systems beyond Linux.
   6.	Better shell communication interaction. For simplicity, commands are buffered, and the user needs to press CRTL-D to display and send the EOF marker.
#Design Considerations
-Socket Programming: Use Python's socket library to handle network connections, ensuring robust and reliable data transmission.
-Multithreading: Implement multithreading for tasks such as port scanning and handling multiple client connections simultaneously.
-Command Execution: Allow the tool to execute shell commands remotely and return the output to the user, similar to Netcat's -e option.
-Port Scanning: Include functionality to scan a range of ports, with the ability to specify both individual ports and port ranges.
-OS Fingerprinting: Implement a feature to gather and transmit detailed information about the operating system of the target machine.
-Command Shell: Provide a command shell mode that allows users to execute commands interactively on the remote machine.
-Data Transmission: Ensure reliable and secure transmission of data, handling various types of input and output efficiently.
-Ease of Use: Design the command-line interface to be user-friendly and similar to the traditional Netcat syntax, making it easy for users to transition.
-Extensibility: Write modular code that can be easily extended with additional features or modifications, allowing users to customize the tool as needed.
